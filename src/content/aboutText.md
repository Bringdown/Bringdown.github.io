My name is Anton Bringner.

I grew up on Orust and currently live in Uddevalla, with the goal of moving to Gothenburg.
I’ve worked as an industrial electrician for the past 9 years. In 2023, I decided to make a
change and applied to a vocational college program.
I chose programming because I’ve always found development interesting. This interest in
understanding how programs are built comes from my main hobby, which is video/computer
games.

Besides my main hobby, I’m also interested in movies and enjoy reading, mostly fantasy.
I’m cheerful and social, like spending time with friends, going to concerts, and enjoying good
food together.

It’s difficult to give a complete picture of myself in a short letter, so I hope we can continue
the conversation through an interview or something similar.
